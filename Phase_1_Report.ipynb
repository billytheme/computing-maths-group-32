The Kaggle source contains useful clarifications about the exact meaning of each feature, which we have drawn upon for this analysis.

It also specifies the diamond’s dimensions as measured in x, y, z. These features contain all the usual metrics used by the professional world to determine a diamond’s worth, so it should be sufficient for the modelling of it as a regression problem.\n",
